    "The Urbanity dashboard is a dashboard that allows users to conduct bivariate analysis of urban features such as building footprint, green view, mean building perimeter, to name a few. In using the dashboard in this exercise, I found the programme extremely accessible and easy to use, what with the enhanced network feature representation providing context behind patterns found across urban features in cities (Yap et al., 2023).\n",
    "I chose to explore Bogota versus Melbourne and compare the indicators Youth vs Mean Building Footprint, the comparison between which I found to not be as straightforward as expected. I chose these two indicators because they may indicate a cityâ€™s quality of mobility, economic activity and how compact and cosmopolitan a city is. Also, if a city is more compact and younger, then there may be higher costs of living, whereby those choosing to start a family or retire may move to outskirts due to economic motivations. I chose these two cities due to their stark climate in geographical climate, cost of living, urban layout, and crime rates etc., although the two cities do both have vibrant cultural hubs, prestigious universities, well-integrated green spaces and well-designed public transport networks. The linear regression generated by Urbanity for Bogota indicated that there was no significant correlation overall. On the map there is a different story with the outskirts of the city indicating a higher points count on the outside of the city plan. Overall, the linear regression graph for Bogota indicates that the city has not much of an overall correlation between mean building footprint and youth whereas Melbourne indicates that there is more of a negative, somewhat exponential, relationship between mean building footprint and youth. On the spatial maps provided by Urbanity, an obvious spatial pattern is observed with the centre of the city and certain neighbourhoods standing out as having higher point counts.\n",
    "As mentioned in Yap, et al., 2023, Urbanity is easy use, demonstrated throughout this analysis, but definitely has a focus on urban physicalism, which can be disconnected from qualitative angles of urban analysis. Overall, the dashboard helped give an overall sense of how a bivariate relationship operates over the structure and sprawl of a city effectively, although the aggregated linear regression graphs for the cities are a little hard to comprehend due to the variety across the city as a whole. The dashboard assumes that its data is of a high quality and could have scope for better customisation of adapting the scale of analysis within the linear regressions, exploring neighbourhoods specifically, and understanding where aggregation is potentially skewing data analysis and presentation in Urbanity.\n"
